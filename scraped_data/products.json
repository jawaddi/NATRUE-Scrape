Moisten the thumb (or index finger if your partner is massaging) with Perineum Massage Oil and glide gently over the tissues, ensuring the massage is painless. Insert the finger into the vagina to around the second finger joint. Massage rhythmically with a light touch on the vaginal wall in a rotating movement, like the hand of a clock moving back and forth from 3 to 9. With each massage the tissues and muscles will feel more relaxed and softer, so that the length of the massage can be increased. Massage the perineum until a light tingling can be felt, then massage the tissue between the vagina and anus gently between the thumb and middle fingers. After massage excess oil can be removed by washing in warm water. If you have any concerns about perineal massage, please consult your midwife or doctor."

        "Description": "Water is the basic element of which the skin can't do without. Water should be taken not only internally but also through an emulsion which helps to moisturize and nourish the outside layer in a proper way. The product used by men and women in order to give the skin the needed hydration is for sure the \"Body Lotion\" which can be considered as a present for the wellness of your skin. Laziness, atmospheric agents or just a lack of time and attention to ourselves undermine the natural hydration of our body and it can happen that the water reserve is altered, leading to an unpleasant result: an extremely dry and lifeless skin. To solve this discomfort we sometimes rely just on liquid emulsions which can be easily found in supermarkets with the conviction to do something good for the skin, ignoring the harmful ingredients that these products often contain. Any kind of cream is able to provide hydration and nutrition to the skin, but only apparently! It is thanks to the use of a high quality cream, rich in active principles with emollient, anti-oxidant and nourishing action, that you are able to soften the skin by increasing the humidity content, and to ensure an absorption with results that persist for the whole day and not just for the first moments after application. The result of the careful research carried out by the N&B laboratories is BODY LOTION, a delicate and refined emulsion ideal for the whole body, rich in natural active ingredients, formulated to help your skin to restore a perfect balance. BODY LOTION is able to protect the skin even in case of redness and leaving it for a long soft velvety. Furthermore it does not contain any kind of harmful substance as Parabens, paraffin, SLS and coloring aggressive substances. BODY LOTION has been realized by the N&B Laboratories with organic extracts which directly derives from the warm ground of a farm in Salento, a few steps away from the manufacturing laboratories, guaranteed and certified organic by ECOGRUPPO ITALIA and NATRUE. Thanks to the extraordinary properties of fresh Aloe Vera Gel extract, combined with extra virgin Olive Oil and Vitamin E contained in Wheat Germ Oil, Apricot kernel oil and sweet Almond Oil, Body Lotion fully perform the following three main functions: MOISTURIZING ACTION, when the water reserve is not in the ideal conditions to support the needs of the body, due to outside agents or to carelessness for the own well being. EMOLLIENT ACTION, when, due to the lack of hydration, the skin becomes dry and cracked with results that are often troublesome.PROTECTIVE ACTION, quando la naturale idratazione viene attaccata da elementi esterni che rendono la pelle più sensibile e potenzialmente più aggredibile (even in case of sun exposure). The presence of hyaluronic acid helps to fight skin imperfections caused the passage of time and makes the skin more elastic and tonic. Thanks to the presence of all these active principles and to our meticulous care to create a product we have realized BODY LOTION, a body cream that helps t o restore the right amount of water into the skin in order to reconstitute the hydrolipidic mantle.

        "Usage": "Each morning after cleansing and toning, gently apply Daily Hydrating Eye Cream with the ring fingers, starting from the inside corner of the eye area and working outwards. Daily Hydrating Eye Cream is light and fast-absorbing, making it ideal for application before applying eye make-up. It is ophthalmologically tested and suitable for contact lens wearers. We recommend applying this fast-absorbing cream before eye make-up. In the evening after cleansing and toning, we recommend applying a Dr. Hauschka Serum for daily, oil-free night care. For advanced care, Renewing Night Conditioner or Sensitive Care Conditioner may be used for a 28-day period several times a year."

        "Description": "Our face is daily exposed to external factors, known as aggressive for the skin as smog, sun and make-up, that make it sensitive and weak. Here comes the need to give specific care and attention to the face, starting from the daily cleansing, to remove impurities and to allow the skin to breathe. Of course it is very important to use an appropriate cleanser in order to get a gentle but deep cleansing and to avoid the use of common soaps containing surfactants and reducing the lipid layer, well-known for leaving the skin dry and fragile. Furthermore, a correct face cleansing is the first rule of any beauty treatment, because, to be truly effective, each kind of cosmetics must be applied when the skin is ready to get it and this happens after a correct cleansing which prepares the face to get all the benefits of the active ingredients contained into Creams. 'Naturalis FACE MILK' is the result of the research carried out by the N&B Laboratories able to give comfort to skin already during the cleaning and to make the skin immediately clean, elastic and smooth , of course all benefits coming from the active principles of organic Aloe Vera gel, organic Wheat germ oil, organic Extra virgin Olive oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Chamomile and Calendula, known for their nourishing, soothing and decongestant functions. 'Naturalis FACE MILK' is a gentle cleansing milk with a natural delicate perfume, able to perfectly cleanse the face skin by softly removing impurities and make-up, in a very natural way and without causing irritation to the skin. The active ingredients make it suitable for all skin types, even the most delicate and sensitive. Perfect also for neck and décolleté. FACE CARE MILK is a natural and gentle cleansing milk which fully respects and softly cleanse our skin, without irritating it, but giving a feeling of soft and pleasant wellbeing.",

        "Description": "The combination of jojoba oil and sea buckthorn pulp oil helps maintain the natural elasticity of the skin and supplies the skin with extra moisture. Jojoba oil has a moisture-regulating effect and protects even mature skin from drying out. Its waxy, light texture fuses with the skin sebum and creates a thin, non-sealing lipid film that allows the skin to breathe. Sea buckthorn pulp oil is rich in natural carotenoids, vitamins A and E as well as palmitoleic acid. The latter is known for its beneficial effects on the skin. The blend of these two valuable oils absorbs quickly into the skin and gives long-lasting moisture without a greasy or sticky skin feel. Due to the high content of carotenoids, the oil has a slightly tinting effect on the skin.",
        "Usage": "- Vegetable oils for skin care: Our skin care oils pamper the skin and are ideal for the daily skin care of face and body. Our jojoba sea buckthorn oil fuses with the skin's own lipid layer and supplies it with vitamins, essential fatty acids and phytochemicals for an all-natural skin care - because we are convinced that nature has everything to offer that our skin needs. - Sensitive care for sensitive face skin: In skin care, less is more: Our jojoba sea buckthorn oil is free from fragrance and essential oils and helps even dry skin to stay moisturised for a long period of time. It also has a good skin tolerance and protects the delicate skin of the face. Jojoba oil contains valuable antioxidants which neutralise free radicals and has an anti-aging effect. The carotenoids in the sea buckthorn oil have a subtle tinting effect and make the skin glow. - Mix & Match: Individual and unique: Every skin is different and so are its needs. Therefore, all of our skin care products can be mixed to match your individual needs. Our jojoba sea buckthorn skin care oil can be combined with your creams and lotions. Just add a small amount to your face cream for more skin elasticity and a natural tinted complexion. - Skin scrubs for face and body: Skin scrubs can help the skin to regenerate and unclog the pores. Making your own scrub with jojoba sea buckthorn oil at home is very easy: Simply mix sea salt, coconut flower sugar, almond meal or coffee grounds (depending on the desired grain) with the oil, gently apply the mixture in circular movements and rinse with lukewarm water. This way, dead cells are removed and the skin is vitalised and pampered. We recommend to use body scrubs in the shower."

        "Ingredients": "Rosa Canina Seed Extract* * certified organic",
        "Description": "Our organic rosehip skin care oil is a moisturising care for face and body with skin-protecting effects. It absorbs slowly and deep into the skin and is suitable for very dry skin and treatment for pigmentation spots and scars. Its essential fatty acids regenerate the skin and help it to stay moisturised and smooth. You can apply the oil directly to the skin or mix it with your creams and lotions. If used as a bath oil, we recommend to mix the oil with cream or milk and stir the mixture in the warm bath water. If applied reguarly, almond oil makes the skin softer and smoother.",
        "Usage": "- Rosehip oil for skin care: Rosehip oil contains trans-retinoic acid which has a healing effect and supports the natural regeneration of the skin. It also stimulates the production of collagen, a substance that promotes the ability of connective tissue to retain moisture. - Rosehip oil combined with other oils: Rosehip oil has a very special property: If combined with other oils, it unfolds further beneficial effects. For instance, if mixed with evening primrose oil which contains gamma-linolenic acid, it supports cell renewal. This makes it valuable for dry, mature and irritated skin. In combination with oils that are rich in oleic acid, such as argan oil, rose hip oil can help maintain the natural barrier layer and smoothes the skin in the long term. Rose hip oil is also ideally suited as supplement for body lotions. Just a small amount of the oil support the skin regeneration and lead to a higher absorption of moisture. - Rosehip oil for overnight treatments: Rosehip oil is perfect for treatments overnight because that way, it can take effect for a longer period of time. Sunlight makes the oil evaporate rather quickly, so it is more effective overnight during the skin's regenerative phase. - Face or body scrubs with skin care oils: Skin scrubs can help the skin to regenerate and unclog the pores. Making your own scrub with our rosehip oil at home is very easy: Simply mix sea salt, coconut flower sugar, almond meal or coffee grounds (depending on the desired grain) with the oil, gently apply the mixture in circular movements and rinse with lukewarm water. Pat the skin dry with a soft towel afterwards to keep the oil on the skin. Dead cells are removed and the skin is revitalised and pampered. The remaining rosehip oil supports the cell regeneration."

        "Description": "Our coconut skin balm Sacha Inchi is a treasure for damaged skin. It is based on virgin coconut oil, sheabutter and mango butter. The exotic oil does not only give the product a pleasant scent, it also acts as a natural protective coat for unsaturated fatty acids. The natural content of omega-3 fatty acids in the valuable Sacha Inchi oil protect and care for the skin. Red palm oil supplies it with antioxidants (vitamins A and E). The balm is ideally suited for the skin care of face and body and also soothes very dry skin areas like elbows or knees. Sacha Inchi – a botanic treasure Sacha Inchi oil contains 50 g alpha-linolenic acid, 35 g linoleic acid and around 10 g oleic acid per 100 g. That means that it has a similarly high content of alpha-linolenic acid like flaxseed oil. This essential fatty acid has regenerating and activating effects on the cells. Sacha Inchi oil has a characteristic, slightly bitter aroma which vanishes shortly after applying it to the skin. The oil is also known as treasure from the Amazon jungle. The indigenous people of the Amazon region and the Incas already appreciated the oil as rich skin care. In South America, Sacha Inchi oil is also a common edible oil. It is extracted from the Inca peanut, a weed-like plant from the family of the Euphorbiaceae. We purchase the Sacha Inchi liana from small organic farmers. This way, we support traditional cultivation methods, the future existence of old crops and species conservation.",
        "Usage": "- Sensitive skin care with Sacha Inchi oil: Our Sacha Inchi coconut skin balm is free from fragrance and essential oils. Therefore, it is especially skin-tolerable. It is most effective to apply the balm on damp skin after a mild cleansing. That way, the valuable ingredients can be absorbed particularly well. The balm also soothes irritated skin after shaving. - Mix & Match: Individual and unique: Every skin is different and so are its needs. Therefore, all of our skin care products can be mixed to match your individual needs. Our Sacha Inchi coconut skin balm can be combined with creams and lotions. Just add a small amount to your face cream for more skin elasticity and extra moisture. - Face or body scrubs: Skin scrubs can help the skin to regenerate and unclog the pores. Making your own scrub with our Sacha Inchi skin balm at home is very easy: Simply mix sea salt, coconut flower sugar, almond meal or coffee grounds (depending on the desired grain) with the balm, gently apply the mixture in circular movements and rinse with lukewarm water. This way, dead cells are removed and the skin is revitalised and pampered. We recommend to use body scrubs in the shower."

The VitaBase alkaline deodorant is absolutely free of aluminum salts and alcohol and contains nourishing aloe vera. Due to its basic property, it helps to bind and neutralize acids through osmosis. The VitaBase alkaline deodorant works by changing the environment of the armpit. The acid sweat is buffered by the alkaline pH value. It is difficult for the bacteria to live in this alkaline environment and the smell of sweat that comes from these bacteria does not occur. Our VitaBase deodorant is free of alcohol. Alcohol in personal care products dries out the skin severely and thus blocks the natural moisturizing mechanism.",

In this context, the Zechstein Sea is one of the most well-known ancient seas. 250 million years ago, it reached from England over the Netherlands and Germany to Russia. Today, the minerals that were left behind after the lake dried up are found in different subterranean layers. The valuable natural magnesium chloride is encountered at around 1500 meters under the earth's surface and turns into magnesium oil with the addition of water. This naturally extracted 31.6% solution is unusual in that it is ready for use and can be applied directly. It is neither reduced, supplemented nor chemically purified. Only products that display the Zechstein logo contain this unique magnesium oil.",
        "Usage": "Basis Balance® Magnesium Oil is a versatile mineral spray. It can be used for skin care and for massage support for muscle tension. The mineral spray can be sprayed directly onto the skin and rubbed in gently. If required, multiple daily applications are possible. After about 10-15 minutes, the liquid that has not been absorbed can be washed off with clean water. The recommended dosage is 10-15 sprays."
