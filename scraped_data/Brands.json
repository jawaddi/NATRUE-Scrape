Amala uses whole plants, rather than isolated plant ingredients, to preserve their unique healing benefits, nurturing properties and maximum efficacy. \n\n- 100% Natural – free of petrochemicals, parabens and genetically-modified ingredients. Products contain a proprietary blend of organic plants and compounds that have natural preservative properties, yielding a shelf life of 24 months. \n\n- Custom distillation and extraction – each plant ingredient is extracted according to its specific composition by master distillers who respect this time-honored tradition. This method preserves each plant’s intrinsic healing properties for the skin. \n\n- 100% organic and food grade emulsifiers - ensure absolute purity and safety for both users and the environment. \n\n- No unnecessary ingredient processing – no bleach, deodorizing, refining or gamma radiation. Each plant maintains its original attributes throughout the product development process in order to keep plant properties as pure and effective as in nature itself. \n\n- Fair trade and ethical sourcing – Amala pays a fair price for superior plant ingredients and sources them exclusively from their sustainable farm partners and trusted suppliers around the world. Additionally, five percent of profits are returned to these local communities to help them preserve their culture and achieve long-term economic sustainability. \n\n- 100% natural fragrance - the aroma of pure essential oils and flower extracts. No animal testing - in fact, Amala has limited its ingredient dossier to those which have been cleared of animal testing since 1979.",

Thus, serene life energy.  Amanprana is a range of products that supports and strengthens our life energy serenely without harming our body or mind. In short: gently and without excess. \n\nAmanprana does not believe in the ‘magic pill’. Amanprana is always organic and vegetarian. Attention is also paid to healthy ecological packaging. We prefer glass over plastic, as it is better for the environ ment, your health and the taste. Whenever possible we print with vegetable inks and on ecological paper. \n\nAt Amanprana we believe in the whole and not in the separate parts. Our products are therefore processed as little as possible and we do not use isolates. Isolates are chemically or naturally fabricated isolated substances that will never be capable of equalling the whole. We do not, for example, add isolated vitamin E but use red palm and wheat germ oil as rich natural sources of vitamin E. \n\nAt Amanprana we are aware of Hippocrates’ wise words: ‘Let nutrition be your medicine and medicine your nutrition.’",

For more than 25 years, farfalla has been producing natural cosmetics on the basis of essential oils according to their extensive knowledge of aromatherapy. It is farfalla's philosophy to act ecologically, humanely and consequently. \n\nFarfalla's vision was inspired by the vision of four school friends. We dreamt of integrating our fascination for natural plant perfumes in our daily work and inspiring others about their powers. Even in our most audacious plans we did not realize that these dreams would become a reality. \n\nIn 1985, we opened Switzerland's first natural perfume shop in Zurich. Over the years, we have become an important supplier of organic products of the highest quality: pure natural essential oils and certified natural cosmetics. Since the very beginning, enthusiasm and joy were our motivation, today we continue to communicate this joy through our products. \n\nThe farfalla team has grown and become international. Each day, the farfalla team meets the challenge of being a \"dream team\" as opposed to a \"team who dreams\".",

My passion for good business cases & the cosmetic industry, which to me is a constant quest or High Quality for a reasonable money. With my insight into and experience with the cosmetics world, I want to make it possible, to offer an ecological & natural based assortment, of the highest quality, for reasonable money. A brand where the ethics are high, an honest brand where you can rely on claims and markting. \n\n2.  ”If you can not stand eating it, then it won´t be healthy for your skin”. The increased awareness of living healthy, - not  feeding your body, either on the outside or the inside, which is not good for it. \n\n3. Taking care of our environment, so that our dearest owner, the descendants of all of us, have an equally beautiful, green  and wonderful world, in the future, as we have today. Personally, I Iove to move around in the nature, whether it is summer or winter, I have daily walking or cycling trips with the family and/or with our dear dog, or on horseback. \n\nHoping very much, that you will enjoy GreenEtiq Denmark, feel the nature and the effective effect, just as much as I do myself.\n\nThe Best Greetings \n\nTine Ejlersen Liebeck",

Since 1988, he has been developing the natural personal care market and leading Laverana as its founder and executive partner. The driving force behind Laverana since its foundation remains its goals of democratization, differentiation, and internationalization.

At the time, effective, natural products suitable for sensitive skin were hard to find, and so out of necessity, Linden Leaves was created.\nBrigit began harvesting and freeze-drying roses, and blending fruit and flower oils with the unique scent of essential oil blends. It became a real labour of love for Brigit, who set out to create beautiful, effective and quality handmade natural products that were kind to the skin.\nFrom a humble family kitchen operation, Linden Leaves has expanded into an internationally recognised brand known for its natural everyday luxury handmade products.\nBrigit's vision for Linden Leaves is to create beautiful, effective and gentle products to nourish the skin and soothe the soul. \n\nOUR PHILOSOPHY\nLinden Leaves supports ethical and sustainable business practices, and as a devoted mother and wife, family holds an essential place in Brigit's life and values. Linden Leaves is genuinely dedicated to family, friendship and respect for one another and the world we live in.\n\nOUR INGREDIENTS\nLinden Leaves products are made using quality organic and natural ingredients, fruit and flower oils, unique scents and essential oil blends. \nOur natural botanical ingredients are sourced locally and sustainably wherever possible, in order to attain the highest possible quality of product. \nWe avoid the use of chemical nasties and irritants such as parabens, silicon oils, sodium lauryl and genetically modified ingredients.\nEach of the active ingredients in our ranges have been carefully studied and selected for their scientifically proven skin enhancing properties.",
